Solution: ","Construct a circle with center A and radius AB
Construct a circle with center B and radius AB, intersecting circle A at points C and D
Construct line AC
Construct line BC
Rationale: A circle contains all points at an equal distance from the center. Since B and C both lie on the circle centered at A, AB=AC; likewise, since A and C both lie on the circle centered at B, AB=BC. As all three sides have the same length, the triangle ABC thus created is equilateral. The same is true for the second triangle ABD.

Rationale: All internal angles of an equilateral triangle are 60°, so you just need to construct the two sides of an equilateral triangle adjacent to vertex A.
The two circles ensure that AB=AC=BC and AB=AD=BD and so ABC and ABD are equilateral and angles CAB and DAB are 60°.

Tool List: ['Perpendicular Bisector Tool']
Solution: ","Description: You have discovered the Perpendicular Bisector tool. Click sequentially on two points to see how it works.
Solution: ","
Rationale: The bisector tool works even when the line between two points has not been drawn; however the dashed line shown by the bisector tool is just visual decoration, and cannot be used by the Point or Intersect tool for selecting the midpoint.  It is also possible to tap-and-hold on one point, then drag to see where the perpendicular bisector will land before releasing at the second point.
In many levels, use of the perpendicular bisector tool can achieve a lower L score than constructing the perpendicular bisector by elementary tools; however, when minimizing the E score, there are often situations where replacing an application of the bisector tool by its three underlying elementary constructions can point out a common underlying circle that can be reused for two perpendicular bisectors.

Solution: ","Description: Inscribe a circle in the square.Given the square ABCD.
Solution: ","Construct line AC.
Construct the perpendicular bisector of AB, intersecting AB at point E and AC at point F.
Construct a circle with center E and radius EF.
Rationale: In a square, the center of the inscribed circle is the intersection of its diagonal and the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of its sides. Constructing one diagonal and one perpendicular bisector is enough to find the center of the circle. One perpendiculor bisector is needed to determine the radius as the inscribed circle passes through all the midpoints of the square's sides.

Use the Move tool to see how the theorem works: just drag the blue points.Let A, B, C, D, E, and F be the 6 points of a hexagon inscribed in a circle.
Solution: ","
Rationale: This level does not construct anything, but does demonstrate Pascal's theorem in use.  As long as opposite sides of the hexagon are not parallel (which cannot be achieved in Euclidea using just the Move tool), they have an intersection; moving a hexagon vertex shows that the dependent intersections H, I, and J remain collinear.
When the move tool is active, one finger on an empty area scrolls, one finger on a point, line, or circle moves that item along with all other items whose construction depends on it, and double-tap-and-drag-up/down zooms.

Rationale: In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors to each other, so given one of the rectangle's diagonal (also one of the rhombus' diagonal), constructing its perpendicular bisector gives you the second diagonal.

Solution: ","Construct the perpendicular bisector P1 of two arbitrary points on the circle.
Construct the perpendicular bisector of two other arbitrary points on the circle, intersecting P1 at point A.
Point at A.      
Rationale: Given any two points on a circle, the perpendicular bisector of the segment made up of those two points passes through the center of the circle. Therefore, by constructing two perpendicular bisectors, you'll find the center.
The 5E solution uses the same reasoning, except you need to construct the perpendicular bisector without using the Perpendicular Bisector tool. As a reminder, in order to build a perpendicular bisector, you just need to construct two circles of equal radius with their centers on the circle and construct the line that passes through the intersections of those two circles. The trick to save 1 Elementary operation is to use one of the existing circles to construct your second perpendicular bisector.

Rationale: Solution 6L is easy as the inscribed square's center is the same as the circle's center, so you can find the vertex opposite to A as its diametrical opposite. That diameter is also a diagonal of the square, so by constructing its perpendicular bisector and second diagonal of the square, you can find the two remaining vertices and just need to trace the whole square.

Tool List: ['Angle Bisector Tool']
Solution: ","Description: You have discovered the Angle Bisector tool. Click on any point on a side, on the vertex, and on any point on the other side.Let A be the vertex of the angle between ray B and C.
Solution: ","With the angle bisector tool active, select one of the two rays, then select the vertex, then select the other ray.
Rationale: The angle bisector tool works with either three clicks (ray, vertex, ray); or with a click on a ray, then click-and-drag on the vertex and release on the final ray; or with a click-and-drag on the first ray with a release on the vertex, followed by a click on the final ray.  Before the final action, the tool gives a visualization of where the bisector will appear.  The angle bisector tool works even for a vertex of a 180° angle (that is, when both rays are collinear), although in such cases, it costs more elementary moves than using the Perpendicular tool.  When selecting a ray, the tool prefers lines, but can also select points; a dashed line is drawn when there is not already a ray from a selected point to the vertex, although that decoration is not usable by the Point or Intersection tool.

Solution: ","Description: Construct the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle are intersected.Given the triangle ABC.
Solution: ","Construct the angle bisector A1 of  angle BAC.
Construct the angle bisector A2 of  angle ACB, intersecting A1 at D.
Rationale: Solution 6E has you manually construct the two angle bisectors. The first two circles has you construct two isosceles triangles ABD and ABE. Considering ABD with its base BD and the circle B, you can construct another circle with center D and the same radius and both circles would intersect along the perpendicular bisector of BD, which coincides with the angle bisector of ∠BAD since ABD is isosceles. Use the same reasoning by considering ABE with is base AE and the circle A and you can construct the perpendicular bisector of AE, which again coincides with the angle bisector of ∠ABE.  Although the same point will be constructed for any two of the three angle bisectors of the triangle, the 6E solution only works when started from the shortest side, as otherwise you would also have to construct a line extension to the other side to locate the point forming the base of an isosceles triangle.

Rationale: In both 5L solutions, triangle ABC is isosceles by construction, with points B and C reflections of one another across the line from A through the center of the circle, even if that line is not drawn.  The next step constructs enough information to also go through the center of the circle (the first solution by drawing a second circle where connecting points D and E would be the perpendicular bisector of a chord AB, the second solution by directly bisecting the chord AC to determine where points D and E lie), while also determining three points that form a pair of equilateral triangles (ABD and ABE for the first solution, ACD and ACE for the second solution).  The next two steps take the perpendicular bisector of the reflected point on circle A through points D and E; the angle bisector of the two points with A as the vertex would produce the same effect, but with a higher E cost.  Regardless of the arc angle of circle A subtended by CDB, constructing the angle bisector after subtracting out the 60° arc along the equilateral triangle means that the resulting bisector will be offset by half of that, or 30°, from the line of symmetry in isosceles triangle ABC, which provides the needed angle for two of the sides of the final triangle.  The third side FG is then trivial to construct.

From there, the constructions use a different choice of circle to determine where remaining vertices of the square will fall.  The 7L solution constructs circle B with a radius that matches the length of a side of the square, such that F is the reflection of D across AB and found on the midpoint opposite from B, and E is the reflection of D across BF and twice as far as the final vertex.  The 10E solution instead constructs circle E at twice the size of circle C, where E is the midpoint of the final square and intersects the remaining three vertices.

Solution: ","Construct the perpendicular bisector of AB, intersecting CD at E and AB at F
Construct the perpendicular bisector of AE, intersecting EF at G
Construct the circle with center G and radius AG (or EG)
Rationale: Consider point A at coordinate (0, 0) and B at (8, 0), such that AB is length 8.  The perpendicular bisector of AB then forms point E along CD at coordinate (4, 8) and F along AB at (0, 8).  The length AF is thus 4; if we can find the point G along EF such that FG is 3 units away from line AB [that is, at coordinate (4, 3)], it will form a 3-4-5 Egyptian right triangle, where AG is then 5 units.  And by subtraction from EF, the length of EG is 5 units, putting point G 5 units away from line CD.  Thus, a circle of radius 5 from point G is tangent to CD and crosses through A and B.  To find point G, consider that the slope of AE is 8:4, so its perpendicular bisector has a slope -4:8 or -1:2.  Line AE crosses its perpendicular bisector at point (2, 4), and that bisector then crosses EF at point (4, 3), giving the desired point G at the center of the circle.

Construct the perpendicular bisector of DG (total 15E)
Rationale: The internal angle at each vertex of a regular hexagon is 120°.  Both solutions start by constructing equilateral triangle ABC to establish a 60° external angle below AB, which in turn gives the desired 120° angle for isosceles triangles BAE and ABF forming the second and third sides of the hexagon.  From there, the 7L solution minimizes moves by directly constructing the remaining sides: the fourth and fifth are easy because a vertex is already present and opposite sides are parallel (the angle bisector tool can be used instead of the parallel tool, but with no difference in E-cost). The final side has no starting vertex, but it can be observed that EFG is an equilateral triangle with sides twice as long as AB, with D at the midpoint of its base, and therefore the perpendicular bisector of DG gives the remaining side.

Solution: ","With the compass tool active, click on one endpoint of the segment, then another endpoint of the segment, then on the destination point.
Rationale: The compass tool works by selecting an initial radius (either click on the two points of the segment, or click-and-hold on one point of the segment and release on the second), followed by selecting a destination center with another click.  The tool visualizes the size of the circle before it lands in its final location, then adds dashed line decorations indicating the two parallel and equivalent-length radii used between the original two points and the destination circle.  Note that the decorations cannot be used as a target by other tools if they do not overlay an already-existing line.  The two original points do not have to lie on a circle, and Euclidea does not allow the destination point to be either of the two source points (even if it did, using the Circle Tool would be a less expensive alternative).  When copying an existing circle, it does not matter whether the first point is the center or on the circumference, as the selected radius will be the same either way for the destination center.

Rationale: For the 9L solution, the emphasis is on producing the remaining 7 sides with as few extraneous moves as possible.  In a regular octagon, all internal angles are 135°, and external angles are 45°.  Like all regular polygons with an even number of sides, any interior angle bisector or perpendicular from a vertex intersects with another vertex.  Thus, the first two moves produce a 45° angle as fast as possible, and while the first four moves provide only two sides, they also serve to locate point G as one of the other vertices, as well as external point F and later I that can be used as the apex of an isosceles triangle to get other sides.  Every remaining move then adds another side, favoring tools with 3E cost (several of the moves could be replaced by a use of the Parallel tool, but at a cost of 4E).
